## Data Structures

Data structures are *structures* that hold some type of *data* together.  In short, they store a collection of related data.

There are four built-in data structures in Python -- list, tuple, dictionary, and set.

#### List

A *list* is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items and you can store a *sequence* of items in a list.  The list items should be enclosed in square brackets, `[]`.  This will specify to Python that a list is being created.  Lists are a *mutable* data type, meaning they can be altered by adding, deleting, or modifying the contents of the list.  Run `help(list)` to display all properties of the *list* data type.

#### Tuple

Tuples are used to hold together multiple objects.  Tuples are similar to lists, but not as extensive as lists are.  Tuples are *immutable*, meaning they cannot be modified.  Tuples are defined by specifying items separated by commas within an option pair of parentheses, `()`. Run `help(tuple)` to display all properties of the tuple data type.

#### Dictionary
