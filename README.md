### Learning Python

This is the repository where I'm logging what I learn with Python 3. I am using [Think Python 2](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/).  

I will also be creating scripts to interact with

I have also created a wiki that will outline my journey on becoming a Python developer and software developer overall.
