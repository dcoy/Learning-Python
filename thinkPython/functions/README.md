## Functions

When defining functions, this allows for reusable pieces of programs.  Functions allow you to name a block of statements and execute that block by calling the specified function name in the program, any number of times.  

Some examples of built-in functions are the `len` and `range` functions:

Len: `len("This is a string")`

Range: `range(1, 10)`

Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.  After using the `def` keyword follows the *identifier* name for that function and a pair of parenthesis which may/may not enclose names of variables, then a *colon* that ends the function definition line.  After this follows the block statements that make up the function.
